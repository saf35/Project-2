My idea changed quite a bit from my pseudo-code, because I want to focus more on the algorithmic design than the game aspect. I wanted to keep the interactivity, though. 

Since my original pseudo-code was based on the idea of the interaction between our happiness and our surroundings, I am still keeping with that theme but doing something different. I want to instead allow people to upload whatever music they want, and they can create different environments and plants based on their favorite music.
